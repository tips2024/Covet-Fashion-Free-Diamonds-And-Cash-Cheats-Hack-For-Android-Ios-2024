### Tip: Focus on **unworn items** to earn additional points, and use outfits from the **current season** to maximize your score. Even borrowing items from your **Fashion House** can give you a boost.

## 3. **Join a Fashion House**

A **Fashion House** in Covet Fashion acts as a community or guild, allowing players to support one another by lending clothing and participating in group challenges called **Runway Rallies**. Runway Rallies reward players with significant prizes, including diamonds and exclusive clothing items. Being part of an **active Fashion House** can give you access to rare items that you might not have in your own closet.

### Tip: If your Fashion House isn’t active or helping you progress, don’t be afraid to switch houses. Look for an active and supportive group to help you grow faster.

## 4. **How to Get Better Ratings**

Improving your **rating** in challenges is one of the most direct ways to earn more diamonds. Aim for a **4-star rating** to win clothing prizes and diamonds, while a **5-star rating** will award you bonus diamonds and premium prizes. Here are some key strategies for achieving higher ratings:

- Use **current season** items for bonus points.
- Wear **unworn items**, including those borrowed from your Fashion House.
- Stick to the challenge's **theme**. Don't stray too far from the concept, as players who vote on your outfit will score you based on how well you follow the theme.
  
By focusing on these aspects, you can improve your chances of getting better ratings and earning rewards consistently.

## 5. **TapJoy Offers for Free Diamonds**

For those looking to earn free diamonds outside of gameplay, **TapJoy offers** are a legitimate way to do so. These offers typically require you to watch videos, download apps, or complete surveys in exchange for diamonds. While this method takes time, it’s a safe and effective way to accumulate free resources.

### Tip: Always make sure to complete offers fully to receive the rewards. This method can be a great way to get extra diamonds without spending real money.

## 6. **Runway Rallies and Styling Sprees**

Participating in **Runway Rallies** with your Fashion House is a powerful way to accumulate diamonds and premium items.

## 7. **Maximizing Your Closet Value**

Your **Closet Value** is an essential part of Covet Fashion that affects how you progress in the game. The more clothing items you own, the higher your Closet Value will be. This value unlocks new hairstyles, makeup, and other customization options. While increasing Closet Value can be expensive, you don’t need to spend real money. Participating in challenges and Runway Rallies will allow you to win free clothing, which adds to your Closet Value.

### Tip: Don't prioritize Closet Value too early in the game. Focus on building a solid wardrobe and completing challenges first, then work on increasing Closet Value as you progress.

## 8. **Boost Your Closet with Borrowed Items**

Borrowing items from fellow members of your **Fashion House** can make a huge difference in your gameplay. When you borrow items, you’re able to use higher-level clothing that you might not be able to afford yet. This helps you perform better in challenges and increase your Closet Value without spending diamonds or cash.

### Tip: Always ask for items that are **unworn** by your housemates, as this will give you extra points in challenges.

## 9. **Ethical Gameplay vs. Cheats**

While it's tempting to search for **hacks** or **cheats** to get unlimited diamonds and cash, it’s important to remember that these methods are not only against the game’s terms of service but can also result in **account suspension** or being **banned** from the game. Covet Fashion has systems in place to detect cheating, and using hacks will often have consequences that outweigh the temporary benefits.

Instead, focus on legitimate strategies to earn diamonds and cash. This not only keeps your account safe but also maintains the integrity of the game for all players.
